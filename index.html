                <p>This is one of the best books I've ever read in my whole life, and I'm not exaggerating.
                    <p>At the first chapter, the amazing Mark Manson briefly tells the reader to stop overthinking about bad things,
                        <p>and how to accept your bad feelings without avoiding it, and then he starts talking about problems that we all face,
                            <p>and that the ultimate happiness comes from solving our problems not from avoiding it.
                                <p> The book then clarifies important points :
                                    <ul>
                                        <li> <p> We should not think too much about others, because when you search if they are satisfied or not, you are looking for the impossible.
                                        <li> <p> We have to know that part of our tragedy is caused by us in one way or another.
                                        <li> <p> Mistakes give us an opportunity to grow and develop, and therefore mistakes are not as bad as we expect.
                                        <li> <p> Our life is not just a coincidence, we were created for a purpose, an end that we do not know, an end that we will know in the middle or at the end of the road, or we may not know it, but there is certainly a purpose in our existence.
                                    </ul>
